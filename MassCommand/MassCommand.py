        This utility is designed to copy and/or run commands/files on all target systems in the specified hosts file.
        By default, it will:
            Parse host_list.txt for hosts & IPs
            Run the command specified using psexec \\\\host_from_host_list.txt command_given
            Crash your workstation if you aren't careful - It runs each in a new cmd window to allow for parallel operations to maximize speed.
                Fully automatic scripts - strongly suggested
        Operation requirements:
            Admin share enabled on target machines
            psexec utility either in the same folder as this command or fully installed
            Ran from network credentials that can access the target machines. Errors out according to normal psexec rules if they don't work.

        Notes:
            Running parallel windows will bog down or crash your system. It attempts to slow this down but not at the cost of usable deployment speed.
            Test with only one or two hosts in the file to make sure it does what you need. Quotes in the command section get to be painful.
            Yes, you could just use psexec @file but it doesn't run in parallel making it slow for +10 computers. Especially if some are offline.
            Compiles a logfile in same directory as output_log.txt once the command completes
